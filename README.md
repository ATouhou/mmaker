## What is this even for?

The main purpose of this project is for my experimentation only, but since it's MIT licensed, then dick, tom and harry can use it if they want, in good old `PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS` style.

## Ok, but what does it do?

This project will allow you to run a `Market Maker` *trading bot* to provide liquidity to markets where a spread exists
